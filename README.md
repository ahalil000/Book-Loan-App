BookLoan App - The Library In The Sky!

The BookLoan App is a web application devised for the Fictitious BookLoan Library for online and cloud. 

I developed this application so that I could incorporate a number of open-source skills that I already have and have acquired over the past 5 years. 

These include utilising the following technologies:

Angular
TypeScript
C#
RxJS
ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Identity
SQL Server
Entity Framework Core
Azure App Services
PaaS
Azure Serverless Functions
Azure Web Jobs
Azure Storage Queues
Azure Service Bus
Git
GitHub
Team City
NUnit
TDD
BDD
CICD
